description1 = '''
Carceral Contagion simulates the mass incarceration epidemic,
which refers to the substantial increase of incarcerated 
individuals in the United States over the past four decades, 
reflective of not only the country's excessively punitive 
criminal justice system, but also its perpetuation of oppression 
along racial lines.'''

description2 = '''The grid to the right represents a simulated community of either black or white individuals, 
each circle labeled with 'M' or 'F' indicating gender. A grey circle indicates that a person has never been incarcerated,
a blue circle indicates the person is currently imprisoned, and a red circle indicates the person has been released from prison
and is able to interact with other agents.'''

description3 = '''The population of the simulation can be increased \
or decreased. \n The average sentence length refers to the maximum amount of time \
in months any individual - once incarcarated - will remain in prison. The longer the sentence, the more \
infectious the possibility of incarceration. The race of the simulated population can be toggled between black and white, illustrating the racial disparity \
in incarceration rates'''
