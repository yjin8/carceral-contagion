description1 = '''
Carceral Contagion simulates the mass incarceration epidemic,
which refers to the substantial increase of incarcerated 
individuals in the United States over the past four decades, 
reflective of not only the country's excessively punitive 
criminal justice system, but also its perpetuation of oppression 
along racial lines.'''

description2 = '''The population of the simulation can be increased \
or decreased. \n The average sentence length refers to how long on average \
the population will stay in prison and the longer the sentence, the more \
"contagious" incarceration is in the simulation.'''

description3 = '''\n The race of the simulated population can be switched between black and white. This is to \
illustrate the difference of the incarceration epidemic between black \
and white populations'''
