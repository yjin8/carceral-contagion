description = '''Carceral Contagion simulates the epidemic that \
is mass incarceration. Mass incarceration refers to the substantial \
increase of incarcerated individuals in the United States over the \
past four decades, reflective of not only the country's \
excessively punitive criminal justice system, but also its \
perpetuation of oppression along racial lines. \n The sliders \
represent different circumstances the user can change about \
the simulation. The population of the simulation can be increased \
or decreased. \n The average sentence length refers to how long on average \
the population will stay in prison and the longer the sentence, the more \
"contagious" incarceration is in the simulation. \n The race of the \
simulated population can be switched between black and white. This is to \
illustrate the difference of the incarceration epidemic between black \
and white populations'''
